# Welcome to Open Sharing 👋

## 🙋‍♀️ Who We Are

**Open Sharing** is an open-source platform designed for individuals and organizations to collaboratively create and share knowledge—whether it's documentation, blog posts, or technical guides—across all kinds of projects.  

Our mission is:

- To provide a collaborative space where multiple contributors can publish and maintain content.
- To support structured, versioned documentation for projects large and small.
- To foster an open, transparent knowledge-sharing culture for teams, communities, and the broader open-source ecosystem.

## 🌈 How We Work

1. **Open Collaboration**: Anyone can contribute content to projects—via Git or an intuitive editor UI.
2. **Structured Content**: Organize documentation, blog posts, and knowledge bases under each project.
3. **Moderation & Access Control**: Projects can define roles (writer, reviewer, publisher) to ensure quality and trust.
4. **Open Access or Private Use**: Choose to make your content public, or use Open Sharing as a private knowledge base for your team.
