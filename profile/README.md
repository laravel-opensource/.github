# Welcome to Laravel OpenSource 👋

## 🙋‍♀️ Who We Are

Laravel OpenSource is an organization dedicated to forking and recreating open-source projects built on the Laravel framework. We don’t just set them up and rebuild them—we also provide detailed video tutorials to help the community easily access and use these projects. Our goals are:

- To deliver fully functional recreations of notable open-source projects.
- To assist users with step-by-step video installation guides.
- To build a community that shares knowledge and expertise about Laravel.

## 🌈 How We Work

1. **Fork Projects**: We carefully select and fork high-quality open-source projects.
2. **Setup & Rebuild**: We recreate the projects in real environments, ensuring everything runs smoothly.
3. **Video Tutorials**: We record and share detailed videos on installing, configuring, and using the projects.

Check out our forked projects at [our repositories](https://github.com/laravel-opensource).
